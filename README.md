# Hello_World_App
## Overview
This challenge was to create a Hello World reader app that would capture logging information and output "Hello World" to the console. In addition to contain an environment variable which can be called. The reader app log must be stored to local filesystem which then can be read by filebeat and sent to elasticsearch index and then visually displayed on a dashboard in Kibana.

## Prerequisites
To Install ... Visual Code Ansible Terraform Filebeat ElasticSearch Kibana

## How it went
This task was challenging and I enjoyed the journey in completing it. There was aspects of the challenge which was new to me such as using new tools: Terraform, Filebeat, ElasticSearch and Kibaana respectfully, in addition researching these open souce materails.

## What did you find most difficult
As these tools are open source there was vast amount of information and knowledge available which took some to decipher. This cause a slight delay to refocus on the core aspect of the challenge. In addition, I overcomplicated the gravity of the task rather than keeping it simple. This was

## What did I enjoy about the challenge
I was fortunate in this challenge to have collaborated with colleagues to understand the way they approached the task and understand the use case for some of the tools. Also I enjoyed the fact that I discovered a solution for Terraform after making a mistake. This was a great learning curve for me.

## What would I do next time
To make sure I have a narrow vision on the challenge and to keep it as simple as possible. Also to have a full understanding of the use cases of all future tools to be used.
